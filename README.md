# autopr

A simple utility that makes it easy to do a pull-request workflow.

Just develop on top of `master`- committing as usual but without pushing. Run `pr` to automatically
move your unpushed changes to a new branch, push to an eponymous remote, and open your browser to
the pull request creation wizard.
