# apr

Sometimes you just aren't sure what you want to call a branch until after you've done started doing
stuff. With `apr` you can defer responsibility for longer!

Just commit directly on top of `master` without pushing your changes.

When you're ready to start a pull request, just run the `apr` command and it'll take all your
unpushed changes and move them onto a new branch.

It'll push the new branch, and then open up your browser to the page to create a new pull request.
